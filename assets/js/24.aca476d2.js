Creating trainable models helps to rapidly detect and classify discriminating features without having to develop a sophisticated algorithm. In fact, detecting objects and locating them in an image is an increasingly vital aspect of computer vision research. This discipline seeks out instances, their class labels and their positions in the visual data. This domain stands at the overlap of two other fields: image classification and object localization. Indeed, object detection is based on the following principle: for a specific image, we look for regions of the image that might contain an object and then, for each of these detected regions, we extract and classify it using an image classification model. Those regions of the initial image showing good classification results are maintained and the remainder is discarded. Thus, for a good object detection method, it is necessary to have a robust region detection algorithm as well as a good image classification model.")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("The following projects and tutorials related to the video detection task are provided for further details:")]),e._v(" "),n("ul",[n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/lbeaucourt/Object-detection",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Object detection project for real-time (webcam) and offline (video processing) application."),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/hjptriplebee/SSD_tensorflow",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Object-detection: Single Shot MultiBox Detector(SSD) in TensorFlow."),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/rlan/darknet",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Darknet"),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/cedrickchee/pytorch-RetinaNet",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v('PyTorch implementation of RetinaNet with the goal to reproduce results in the "focal loss for dense object detection" paper.'),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/ogbanugot/Robosapien-Object-Detector-using-Darkflow",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Robosapien object detector using Darkflow"),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/siddartha19/Object-Detection-Application",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Object Detection Application"),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("p",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-object-detection-9ba089154df8",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Understanding Object Detection"),n("OutboundLink")],1)])])]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("The following are some useful books that will help you learn the different aspects of object detection:")]),e._v(" "),n("ol",[n("li",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qja79-QaoJHEO-MVQ1oDZwsAAAFwtKQVSwEAAAFKAQDMYqQ/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Applied-Deep-Learning-Convolutional/dp/1484249755?creativeASIN=1484249755&linkCode=w61&imprToken=bnWxJoN9ehtfoAkba-1ChA&slotNum=3&tag=uuid10-20",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Advanced Applied Deep Learning"),n("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qja79-QaoJHEO-MVQ1oDZwsAAAFwtKQVSwEAAAFKAQDMYqQ/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Detection-Low-spatial-resolution-Imagery-Convolutional-Networks/dp/1688093427?creativeASIN=1688093427&linkCode=w61&imprToken=bnWxJoN9ehtfoAkba-1ChA&slotNum=9&tag=uuid10-20",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Object Detection in Low-spatial-resolution Aerial Imagery Using Convolutional Neural Networks"),n("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qja79-QaoJHEO-MVQ1oDZwsAAAFwtKQVSwEAAAFKAQDMYqQ/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Hierarchical-approach-object-detection-descriptors/dp/3330353066?creativeASIN=3330353066&linkCode=w61&imprToken=bnWxJoN9ehtfoAkba-1ChA&slotNum=15&tag=uuid10-20",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Hierarchical approach for object detection using shape descriptors"),n("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),n("li",[n("a",{attrs:{href:"https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qja79-QaoJHEO-MVQ1oDZwsAAAFwtKQVSwEAAAFKAQDMYqQ/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Application-Deep-Learning-Object-Detection/dp/613945705X?creativeASIN=613945705X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=bnWxJoN9ehtfoAkba-1ChA&slotNum=21&tag=uuid10-20",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Application of Deep Learning in Object Detection\nApplication of Deep Learning in Object Detection using Tensorflow"),n("OutboundLink")],1)])]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("###"),n("strong",[e._v("Object localization v.s. object classification")]),e._v("\nObject detection consists of identifying and locating one or several objects in the image.

Locating an object in an image is complex and measuring the localization performance needs an adapted metric. Moreover, unlike classification, several targets can be located in the same image and the detector must be able to accurately locate them. For a single input, an object detector returns the detected objects in the image and their associated bounding boxes. Some strategies are available to address this challenge. The first one(see Figure 1), based on object recognition approaches, essentially consists of simply predicting the size of a bounding box and the class to which it belongs.
