# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is the process of gathering, combining, structuring and organizing data so it can be analyzed as part of data visualization, analytics and machine learning applications.

Data preprocessing is an ensemble of technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format.
Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.

It' the core ability of any data scientist or data engineer, and you must be able to manipulate, clean, and structure data during you everyday work (besides expecting that this will take the most of your daily-time!).

There are a lot of differente data types out there, and they deserve different ways of treating them.

As usual the structure I've planned to follow to get you started with data preprocessing, it consists of having a general overview first, and then dive deep into each data type situation you can encounter. 

The general steps of data preprocessing are the following:

- Data Overview
- Data Cleaning
- Data
- Data Discretization
- Data Integration
- Data Red
